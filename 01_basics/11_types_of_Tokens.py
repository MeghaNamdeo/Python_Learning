'''Punctuator : it is a symbols to organize sentence structure in programming.

(),{},@,[],#,etc.
-=,+=,/=,*=,//=,= etc 

python is implict typed language 
impilcit means alag se typr batne ki jarurrat nahi hoti  like python 
explicit me humko type batnna parta hai ki konsa type ka data type hai like cpp, java  

Exresion Execution 

Srtring & Numeric values can operate together with *   //repeat

A, B = 2, 3 
Txt = "@"
print(2*Txt*3) output : @@@@@@

String & String can operate with + 
A, B = "2", 3
Txt = "@"
print ((A+Txt)* B) output 2@2@2@

Numeric values can operate with all arithmetic operators

A,B = 2, 3
C=4
print(A+B*C)  output = 14 

Arithmetic expression with integer and float will result in float 

A, B = 10 , 5 . 0 
C = A*B
print(C)    output = 50.0

Result of division operator with two integers will be float 
A, B = 1, 2
C = A/B
print (C)  output 0.5

Integer division with float and int will give int displayed as float
A, B = 1.5 , 3
C = A//B 
print(C, A/b) output 0.0 0.5


floor gives closest integer , which is lesser than or equal to the float value 
Result of (A//B) is same as floor(A/B)

A,B = 12 , 5 
C= A//B
print(C) output :2 

A, B = 12, 5
c = A//B
print(C) output -3

A, B = 12, -5
C = A//B
print(C) output -3

Remainder is negative when denominator is negative 
// numerator ,denominator  = ans
+, + = +
-,- = +
+ , - =  - 
- , + = +

A, B = -5 , 2
C = A  % B
print (C) output 1 

A,B=5, 2
C = A % B 
print(C)

A, B  = 5 , -2 
C = A % B 
print (C) output -1
